        "Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception? There may be one or more correct choices.\nOptions: A: Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.\nB: Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.\nC: Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of progestins.\nD: Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of estrogens.\nE: Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of progestins.",

        "A: Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.\n\nRifampin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can alter the normal gastrointestinal flora. This can lead to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. Estrogens are normally metabolized in the liver and then excreted in the bile. Some of the estrogens that are excreted in the bile are reabsorbed in the intestine, a process known as enterohepatic circulation. Rifampin can alter the normal gastrointestinal flora, which can lead to a decrease in the reabsorption of estrogens. This can result in a decrease in the levels of estrogens in the body, which can make oral contraceptives less effective.",
        "Rifampin is a potent inducer of the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4, which metabolizes both estrogens and progestins. This can lead to decreased levels of these hormones in the bloodstream, potentially reducing the efficacy of OCPs. Additionally, rifampin alters the normal gastrointestinal flora, which can interfere with the enterohepatic circulation of both estrogens and progestins, further reducing their bioavailability. Therefore, additional contraception is necessary to prevent unplanned pregnancy while taking rifampin."

        "Question: A 46-year-old woman presents with a 5-month history of worsening dry cough, occasional shortness of breath, and fatigue. She says she is now having trouble walking a full block. For the past week, she also has noticed bilateral swelling of the lower legs. She denies chest pain, fever, chills, syncope, or bloody sputum. Current vitals include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 63/min, blood pressure 128/91 mm Hg and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following are the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient? There may be one or more correct choices.\nOptions: A: Bronchoalveolar wash\nB: Cardiac echo\nC: Echocardiography\nD: Chest CT\nE: Biopsy of the heart",

        "The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of heart failure. Cardiac echo and echocardiography are both imaging tests that can be used to assess the structure and function of the heart, and are therefore the most appropriate next steps in the diagnosis of this patient.\n\nBronchoalveolar wash, chest CT, and biopsy of the heart are not indicated at this time. Bronchoalveolar wash is used to collect samples of fluid from the lungs, and is typically used to diagnose or treat lung infections. Chest CT is a imaging test that can be used to visualize the lungs, but is not typically used to diagnose heart failure. Biopsy of the heart is a invasive procedure that is typically only performed when other tests have failed to provide a diagnosis.",
        "Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart. It can be used to assess the structure and function of the heart, and to identify any abnormalities.\n\nA biopsy of the heart is a more invasive procedure that involves taking a small sample of heart tissue for examination under a microscope. This is typically only done if other tests have not been able to provide a diagnosis.\n\nA chest CT scan is also a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to create detailed pictures of the chest. However, it is not typically the first-line test for diagnosing heart failure.\n\nA bronchoalveolar wash is a procedure that involves flushing the lungs with a saline solution and then collecting the fluid for analysis. This is typically done to diagnose lung infections or to collect samples of lung tissue for biopsy.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient is a cardiac echo."

        "The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which can lead to Korsakoff syndrome. Korsakoff syndrome is a disorder of the nervous system caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine is essential for the proper functioning of the brain and nervous system. Korsakoff syndrome can cause a variety of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with coordination.\n\nThe patient also has multiple falls and episodes of dizziness, which are consistent with cerebellar degeneration. Cerebellar degeneration is a condition in which the cerebellum, a part of the brain that is responsible for coordination and balance, is damaged. Cerebellar degeneration can be caused by a variety of factors, including alcohol abuse, stroke, and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe patient's wide-based gait, inability to stand with his feet together without support, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands are all consistent with cerebellar degeneration.
