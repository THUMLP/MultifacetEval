        "Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?\nOptions: A: Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.\tB: Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.\tC: Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of progestins.\tD: Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of estrogens.\tE: Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of progestins.",
        "A",
        "Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4, an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs. This can lead to decreased levels of contraceptive hormones in the bloodstream, making them less effective at preventing pregnancy. Rifampin also alters the normal gastrointestinal flora, which can lead to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens, further reducing their effectiveness. Estrogens undergo enterohepatic circulation, which is a process by which they are absorbed from the gut, metabolized by the liver, and then reabsorbed into the gut. Rifampin alters the normal gastrointestinal flora, which can lead to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens, resulting in lower levels of estrogen in the bloodstream and potentially reducing the effectiveness of combination oral contraceptive pills. Therefore, the patient should use additional contraception, such as condoms, while taking rifampin."

        "Question: A 46-year-old woman presents with a 5-month history of worsening dry cough, occasional shortness of breath, and fatigue. She says she is now having trouble walking a full block. For the past week, she also has noticed bilateral swelling of the lower legs. She denies chest pain, fever, chills, syncope, or bloody sputum. Current vitals include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 63/min, blood pressure 128/91 mm Hg and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient?\nOptions: A: Bronchoalveolar wash\tB: Pulmonary function studies\tC: Echocardiography\tD: Chest CT\tE: Biopsy of the heart",
        "C",
        "Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging test that uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart. It is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient because it can provide information about the structure and function of the heart, including the size and shape of the heart chambers, the thickness of the heart walls, and the movement of the heart valves. This information can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, such as heart failure, valvular heart disease, or pericardial effusion."

        "Question: A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with constant abdominal pain over the past 8 hours. The pain is in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is also where it began. She has had no nausea or vomiting despite eating a snack 2 hours ago. She had a similar episode last month which resolved on its own. Her menstrual cycles are 28\u201330 days apart with 3\u20135 days of vaginal bleeding. Her last menses ended 9 days ago. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 78/min, the respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.5 mg/dL\nLeukocyte count 6000/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 55%\nLymphocytes 39%\nPlatelet count 260,000/mm3\nSerum  \nC-reactive protein 5 mg/L (N < 8 mg/L)\nUrine  \nRBC 1-2 phf\nWBC None\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions: A: Methotrexate\tB: Nitrofurantoin\tC: Reassurance\tD: Referral for surgery\tE: Tamsulosin",
        "C",
        "The most appropriate next step in management is reassurance because the symptoms are consistent with a self-limited episode of mittelschmerz, which is a brief, sharp, unilateral pain that occurs during ovulation. The pain is typically located in the lower abdomen and can last for a few minutes to several hours. It is usually not associated with any other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The diagnosis of mittelschmerz is based on the patient's history and physical examination. Laboratory studies are not typically needed. Treatment is usually not necessary, but reassurance can be helpful in alleviating anxiety."

        "Question: A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness over the past 6 weeks. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He drinks one pint of rum daily. He works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\nOptions: A: Korsakoff syndrome\tB: Subacute combined degeneration\tC: Methanol poisoning\tD: Cerebellar degeneration\tE: Wernicke's encephalopathy",
        "D",
        "The patient has a wide-based gait, inability to stand with feet together without support, coarse tremor of the hands, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands. These findings suggest cerebellar dysfunction. The patient is a chronic alcoholic, which is a risk factor for cerebellar degeneration."

        "Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from his bicycle. The boy was racing with his cousin when he lost control and fell onto his right side. He has nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder. He is in acute distress. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Examination shows swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle and pain exacerbated by movement; range of motion is limited. The skin over the clavicle is intact. The radial pulse in the right arm is intact. Sensory examination of the right upper limb shows no abnormalities. An x\u2011ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder?\nOptions: A: Perform tension banding\tB: Apply a clavicular plate\tC: Apply a simple shoulder sling\tD: Obtain an MRI of the right shoulder\tE: Perform arteriography",
        "C",
        "The x-ray shows a minimally displaced fracture of the right clavicle. The patient has tenderness over the fracture site and pain with movement of the right shoulder. The radial pulse is intact, and there are no neurological deficits. The next step is to apply a simple shoulder sling to immobilize the fracture and provide comfort."
