It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA.

Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms.

[159, "Question: An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements.

[486, "Question: Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab.

Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 ml of turbid fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows:\nErythrocyte count 1/mm3\nLeukocyte count 4,000/mm3\nGlucose 59 mg/dl\nLactate dehydrogenase 248 U/L\nProtein 3.8 g/dL\n. \"Nephrotic syndrome is not the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion.\", is the statement above true or false?

Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering.

[635, "Question: A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission).

She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs.
