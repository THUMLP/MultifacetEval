[5, "Question: A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath. He notes that he stopped taking his furosemide two weeks prior, because he ran out of pills. On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?\nOptions: A: Normal Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, normal diffusion distance\tB: Decreased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, normal diffusion distance\tC: Decreased Aa gradient, increased surface area for diffusion, decreased diffusion distance\tD: Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance\tE: Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance", "E", ["The patient has fluid in his lungs, secondary to his cessation of furosemide. The fluid in his lungs causes decreased surface area for diffusion. The diffusion distance is normal, as the alveoli are intact. Therefore, the patient has a decreased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, and normal diffusion distance. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The correct answer is: E: Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance\nExplanation:\nDue to the patient's shortness of breath, the most likely source of the symptoms is that he has a significant amount of interstitial fluid within the alveolus. Some amount of water vapor is supposed to be present within the alveolus. However, an excess amount would cause the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide to decrease within the alveolus. Likewise, water vapor in the alveolus would also increase the diffusion distance for both oxygen and carbon dioxide. Lastly, the amount of surface area available for diffusion would decrease due to the interstitial fluid.", "The patient has shortness of breath and crackles throughout his lungs. His jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe, indicating volume overload. His oxygen saturation is decreased, and his EKG and troponin levels are normal, indicating that his pulmonary symptoms are not due to a cardiac etiology. The most likely cause of his pulmonary symptoms is pulmonary edema due to his furosemide non-compliance. Pulmonary edema is characterized by increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, and normal diffusion distance. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient has pulmonary edema, which is the buildup of fluid in the lungs. This can lead to a decrease in the surface area for diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as an increase in the diffusion distance. The Aa gradient is the difference in the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli and the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. In pulmonary edema, the Aa gradient is increased due to the decrease in the surface area for diffusion and the increase in the diffusion distance. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has crackles throughout the lungs, indicating pulmonary edema. The alveoli are filled with fluid, which decreases the surface area for diffusion of oxygen. The decreased surface area for diffusion leads to an increased Aa gradient. Therefore, the answer is: E"]]

She also has bloody diarrhea. These findings suggest that she has a right-sided colonic infection, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The most appropriate surgical intervention for this patient is a right hemicolectomy, which is the removal of the right half of the colon. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The A-a gradient is the difference between the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO<sub>2</sub>) and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>). A decreased A-a gradient occurs when the PAO<sub>2</sub> is increased or when the PaO<sub>2</sub> decreases. In this patient, the A-a gradient is 10 mm Hg, which is decreased. This suggests that the PaO<sub>2</sub> is decreased. The most likely cause of this is a right-to-left blood shunt, which is a condition in which blood passes from the right side of the heart to the left side of the heart without passing through the lungs. This can occur when there is a hole in the heart, such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD).

These pouches can become inflamed and infected, leading to a condition called diverticulitis. The release of lysosomal enzymes from damaged neutrophils and macrophages is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion. Therefore, the answer is: E", "Certain microbial products, including lipoteichoic acid (LTA), are potent amplifiers of inflammation. LTA is a glycerol teichoic acid found in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus.

The CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. This suggests that the patient has diverticulitis with a pelvic abscess. The most likely cause of the abscess is infection with Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. The release of LTA from these bacteria is likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The drained lesion is a pericolic abscess, which is a collection of pus around the colon. Pericolic abscesses are usually caused by the rupture of a diverticulum, which is a small pouch that can form in the wall of the colon. The rupture of a diverticulum can release bacteria and other material into the surrounding tissue, leading to the formation of an abscess. Lysosomal enzymes are released by white blood cells and are involved in the destruction of bacteria and other foreign material. Therefore, the release of lysosomal enzymes is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion. Therefore, the answer is: E", "Lysosomal enzymes are released from activated neutrophils and macrophages during the inflammatory response. These enzymes can degrade tissue and contribute to the formation of abscesses. In this case, the patient has a pelvic abscess that was drained. Therefore, the answer is: E", "Lysosomal enzymes are released from neutrophils and macrophages during inflammation. They are capable of digesting a variety of tissues, including bacteria, cellular debris, and damaged host cells.

It is normally excreted in the bile, which is a fluid that is produced by the liver and helps to digest fats. In this patient, the most likely cause of defective bilirubin excretion is intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting can lead to a decrease in the production of bile, which can cause bilirubin to build up in the blood and lead to jaundice.

The episode 4 years ago is a clue that he is likely developing a recurrent cholestatic syndrome, though the cause is unknown. The most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms is decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is the enzyme responsible for converting bilirubin to a water-soluble form that can be excreted in the bile. A deficiency of this enzyme can lead to a buildup of bilirubin in the blood, which can cause jaundice.

Bilirubin is a waste product that is produced when red blood cells break down. If the liver is unable to process bilirubin properly, it can build up in the blood and cause jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and eyes. Macrovesicular steatosis can be caused by a number of factors, including alcohol abuse, obesity, and diabetes. In this patient, the most likely cause is intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is a popular weight loss diet that involves alternating periods of eating and fasting. This can lead to a build-up of fat in the liver, which can cause macrovesicular steatosis.

Phototherapy is the recommended initial treatment. It works by converting bilirubin to a form that can be excreted by the liver. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The best treatment for this condition is to continue normal breast feeding because physiological jaundice occurs in 50% to 60% of newborns and usually peaks at 3 to 5 days of life. It is associated with increased bilirubin production from the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin, a short half-life of bilirubin, and immaturity of the liver's ability to conjugate and excrete bilirubin. Physiological jaundice usually resolves by 2 weeks of age as the liver matures. Phototherapy is used to treat hyperbilirubinemia when the serum bilirubin concentration exceeds certain levels or if the jaundice is associated with risk factors for kernicterus, such as prematurity or hemolytic disease of the newborn. Phenobarbital administration is used to treat hyperbilirubinemia caused by certain conditions, such as neonatal cholestasis or Gilbert syndrome. Plasma exchange is used to treat severe hyperbilirubinemia that is unresponsive to other treatments.

The most likely diagnosis is tetralogy of Fallot, which is a combination of 4 heart defects: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The murmur is caused by the pulmonary stenosis, which obstructs the flow of blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. The cyanosis is caused by the right-to-left shunting of blood through the ventricular septal defect. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has a heart murmur and symptoms of cyanosis and irritability. These symptoms are consistent with tetralogy of Fallot, which is a congenital heart defect characterized by four abnormalities: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The pulmonary stenosis obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs, which leads to cyanosis. The ventricular septal defect allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, which further contributes to cyanosis. The overriding aorta allows blood from both ventricles to enter the aorta, which can lead to heart failure. Right ventricular hypertrophy is a compensatory mechanism that helps to maintain blood flow to the lungs. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Tetralogy of Fallot is the most likely diagnosis because it is the most common cyanotic heart defect in children. It consists of four defects: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, dextroposition of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The pulmonary stenosis obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs, causing cyanosis. The ventricular septal defect allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, further increasing the cyanosis. The dextroposition of the aorta means that the aorta arises from the right ventricle instead of the left ventricle, which allows oxygenated blood to be pumped to the body instead of the lungs. The right ventricular hypertrophy is a result of the increased workload on the right ventricle. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Tetralogy of Fallot is the most likely diagnosis for this patient. It is a congenital heart defect that consists of four abnormalities: \n-Pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve) \n-Ventricular septal defect (hole in the wall between the ventricles) \n-Overriding aorta (the aorta is positioned over both ventricles) \n-Right ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement of the right ventricle) \nThese abnormalities can cause the patient to experience shortness of breath, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin), and irritability.

Bilateral basilar fine crackles on noted on pulmonary auscultation. Expiratory flow rates are measured and found to be high when corrected for lung volume. A chest X-ray is performed and shown in the image below. Which of the following most likely accounts for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient?\nOptions: A: Anatomical dead space\tB: Lung compliance\tC: Physiological dead space\tD: Radial traction on airway wall\tE: Small airway wall thickness", "D", ["In the image of the chest X-ray, there are numerous small round lung opacities that are consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. The increased expiratory flow rate in this patient is most likely due to radial traction on airway wall. As the lung tissue surrounding the airways becomes fibrotic and scarred, it exerts a pull on the airway walls, causing them to narrow. This narrowing of the airways increases the resistance to airflow, and the patient has to exhale with more force to move the same amount of air out of the lungs. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The increased expiratory flow rate in this patient is most likely due to the presence of anatomical dead space. Anatomical dead space is the portion of the respiratory system that does not participate in gas exchange. This includes the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. In this patient, the increased expiratory flow rate is likely due to the presence of emphysema, which causes the destruction of the alveoli and an increase in the anatomical dead space. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Increased expiratory flow rate is a feature of increased lung elastic recoil. Normally, during expiration, recoil generated from the surrounding lung tissue retards air flow, thereby preserving some intrathoracic gas for the next inspiration. In conditions associated with increased lung elastic recoil, such as interstitial fibrosis (as seen in this patient), the outward recoil forces are markedly increased, which leads to more rapid expiratory air flow. Therefore, the answer is: B", "A chest X-ray shows a reticular pattern in the lower lung fields and bilateral pleural effusions. Emphysema can result in increased expiratory flow rates due to the loss of elastic recoil, which causes the airways to collapse during expiration. This collapse creates a pressure gradient that promotes airflow out of the lungs. The loss of elastic recoil also results in an increase in the anatomical dead space, which is the portion of the respiratory tract that does not participate in gas exchange. However, the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient is most likely due to the radial traction on the airway wall caused by the pleural effusions. This traction helps to keep the airways open during expiration, allowing for increased airflow. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Radial traction on airway wall. In this patient, the increased expiratory flow rate is most likely due to radial traction on the airway wall. Radial traction is caused by the increased lung volume and decreased lung compliance that occurs in interstitial lung disease. This increased lung volume and decreased lung compliance cause the airways to be stretched and narrowed, which increases the resistance to airflow. The increased resistance to airflow results in increased expiratory flow rates. Therefore, the answer is: D"]]

Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has headaches, nausea, and vomiting, along with bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space on MRI. This suggests that CSF flow is impaired. The most likely explanation for this is impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations, which are small protrusions of the arachnoid membrane that allow CSF to drain into the dural venous sinuses. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has headaches associated with nausea and vomiting, which are suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. The MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space, which are also suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. The most likely explanation for the patient's condition is impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations. The choroid plexus is responsible for producing CSF, and the arachnoid granulations are responsible for absorbing CSF.

The prominent rugae in the gastric fundus and parietal cell atrophy on biopsy are characteristic findings in pernicious anemia. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has a history of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with weight loss and bilateral pitting pedal edema. Endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus, and biopsy shows parietal cell atrophy. These findings suggest pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of gastric parietal cells, leading to decreased production of intrinsic factor and impaired absorption of vitamin B12.

The hemoglobin is 7.2 g/dL (normal 12–15.5 g/dL), and MCV is 90 fL (normal 80–100 fL). The peripheral smear shows microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?\nOptions: A: Iron deficiency\tB: Vitamin B12 deficiency\tC: Both A and B\tD: Folate deficiency\tE: Sickle cell anemia\nAnswer: Iron deficiency is the most likely underlying cause because the patient has pallor, a palpable spleen, microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes, and a low hemoglobin level. The MCV is also low, which is consistent with iron deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency can also cause anemia, but they typically do not cause microcytosis or hypochromia. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. It is usually diagnosed in childhood. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Parietal cell atrophy with gastric rugae is characteristic of autoimmune gastritis. This disorder is caused by an autoimmune attack on the gastric mucosa, leading to destruction of the parietal cells. Parietal cells are responsible for secreting hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Therefore, autoimmune gastritis can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and pernicious anemia. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is ectopic secretion of gastrin. Gastrin is a hormone that stimulates the secretion of gastric acid and pepsin. In autoimmune gastritis, the parietal cells are destroyed, which leads to a decrease in gastric acid secretion. This decrease in gastric acid secretion can lead to a compensatory increase in gastrin secretion by the G cells of the stomach. The increased gastrin secretion can then lead to the development of gastric ulcers and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has also had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss during this time. Physical examination shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. An endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus.

This is a finding that is associated with candidiasis, which is the likely diagnosis in this patient given the presence of white plaques on the tongue and mouth that have a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH. Candidiasis is a common fungal infection that is caused by Candida albicans. It can occur in the mouth, throat, skin, and vagina. Delayed separation of the umbilical cord is a finding that is associated with candidiasis because it is a sign of impaired immune function. In this patient, the delayed separation of the umbilical cord is likely due to the fact that he had cardiac surgery as an infant. Cardiac surgery can lead to immune dysfunction, which can make the patient more susceptible to infections such as candidiasis. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has white plaques on the tongue and mouth, which are characteristic of oral candidiasis. The scraping of this material reveals a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH, which confirms the diagnosis.

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all).

The cysts in ADPKD are typically filled with fluid and can vary in size from small to large. As the cysts grow, they can cause the kidneys to enlarge and compress the surrounding tissue. This can lead to pain, hypertension, and kidney failure. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient has bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses, bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses on renal ultrasonography, and a history of urinary tract infections. These findings suggest autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which is the most common form of polycystic kidney disease. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure. Therefore, the answer is: C", "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a hereditary disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys.

The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions: A: Initiate proton pump inhibitor\tB: Obtain abdominal ultrasound\tC: Reassurance and counseling on positioning\tD: Recommend modification of mother’s diet\tE: Switch to hydrolyzed formula", "C", ["Reassurance and counseling on positioning is the best next step in management.

Gastroesophageal reflux is the movement of stomach contents back into the esophagus. It is a common problem in infants and usually resolves on its own by 12 months of age. Treatment for gastroesophageal reflux includes feeding the infant smaller meals more often, keeping the infant upright after meals, and elevating the head of the infant's bed. Proton pump inhibitors and abdominal ultrasounds are not indicated in this patient. Modifying the mother's diet is not necessary, and switching to hydrolyzed formula is not indicated unless the patient has a food allergy. Therefore, the answer is: C", "Reassurance and counseling on positioning is the best next step in management because the patient's symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), which is a common problem in infants. GER occurs when the contents of the stomach flow back into the esophagus. This can cause regurgitation, which is the involuntary passage of stomach contents into the mouth. Regurgitation is usually not harmful and does not require treatment. However, in some cases, GER can lead to complications, such as esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus. Reassurance and counseling on positioning can help to reduce the risk of complications from GER. Therefore, the answer is: C", "Reassurance and counseling on positioning is the best next step in management because the symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), which is a common condition in infants. GER is the movement of stomach contents back into the esophagus. It is usually caused by a weak or relaxed lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is the muscle that prevents stomach contents from moving back into the esophagus. GER can cause regurgitation, which is the involuntary passage of stomach contents back into the mouth. It can also cause vomiting, which is the forceful expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth. In most cases, GER is not a serious condition and will resolve on its own as the infant grows and the LES matures. Treatment for GER typically includes lifestyle changes, such as feeding the infant smaller meals more frequently, keeping the infant upright after feedings, and avoiding tight clothing. In some cases, medication may be necessary to reduce stomach acid production. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The best next step in management is reassurance and counseling on positioning.

This finding is characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the spine and other joints. In ankylosing spondylitis, the ligaments and tendons that connect the vertebrae become inflamed and eventually ossify, leading to a stiffening of the spine and a decrease in mobility. When the patient stands upright, the weight of the body compresses the spine and narrows the spinal canal, which can cause pain and other neurological symptoms.

His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?\nOptions: A: Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins\tB: Reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament\tC: Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins\tD: Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling\tE: Depletion of intracellular calcium", "D", ["The rigidity observed is due to the effect of low temperature on muscle proteins. When the body temperature drops, the activity of enzymes that break down muscle proteins decreases. This leads to an accumulation of muscle proteins, which causes the muscles to become stiff and rigid. Therefore, the answer is: C", "After death, muscles enter a state of relaxation known as primary flaccidity. This is due to the depletion of ATP, which is necessary for muscle contraction. However, within a few hours, the muscles begin to stiffen, a process known as rigor mortis. Rigor mortis is caused by the interaction of actin and myosin filaments in the muscle fibers. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of calcium ions. As calcium levels decrease, the interaction between actin and myosin weakens, and the muscles relax. Therefore, the answer is: E", "After death, the muscles of the body go through a series of changes known as rigor mortis. Rigor mortis is caused by the depletion of ATP, which is necessary for the relaxation of muscles. As ATP is depleted, the myosin heads remain attached to the actin filaments, causing the muscles to become stiff and rigid. This process typically begins within a few hours after death and reaches its peak within 12-24 hours. The rigidity then gradually resolves over the next few days. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The rigidity observed is due to the activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins in the coral snake's venom. These neurotoxins bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, causing an influx of sodium ions and a sustained depolarization of the muscle fiber. This depolarization leads to the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which triggers muscle contraction. The sustained depolarization and depletion of calcium ions results in a state of continuous muscle contraction known as rigor mortis. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Rigor mortis is a temporary stiffening of the body that occurs after death. It is caused by the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the muscles, which leads to the formation of linkages between actin and myosin filaments in the muscles. This phenomenon is responsible for the rigidity observed in the graduate student's body. Therefore, the answer is: E"]]

She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the breasts shows a secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola. Pubic hair is sparse and lightly pigmented. Abdominal examination shows bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses. Pelvic examination shows a blind-ended vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?\nOptions: A: Spironolactone therapy\tB: Gonadectomy\tC: Testosterone therapy\tD: Vaginal dilatory therapy\tE: Prednisolone therapy", "B", ["The patient has primary amenorrhea, sparse pubic hair, and bilateral inguinal masses. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. This suggests androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is a disorder in which the body is unable to respond to androgens. Androgens are hormones that are responsible for the development of male sexual characteristics. In AIS, the body is unable to use androgens to develop male sexual characteristics, such as a penis and testicles. Instead, the body develops female sexual characteristics, such as breasts and a vagina. The most appropriate treatment for AIS is gonadectomy, which is the surgical removal of the testicles. The testicles are the source of androgens in the body, and removing them will stop the production of androgens. This will help to prevent further masculinization and will also reduce the risk of developing testicular cancer. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Gonadectomy is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition, which is complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). CAIS is a rare genetic disorder in which the body does not respond to androgens, such as testosterone. This can lead to a variety of developmental abnormalities, including the absence of a uterus and ovaries, and the presence of blind-ended vaginal pouches. Testosterone therapy may be used to induce masculinization in patients with CAIS, but it is not necessary in all cases. Vaginal dilatory therapy may be used to enlarge the vaginal opening, but it is not a cure for CAIS. Prednisolone therapy is not indicated for the treatment of CAIS.

The most appropriate treatment for AIS is gonadectomy (surgical removal of the testes) to prevent the development of testicular cancer. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has primary amenorrhea, bilateral inguinal masses, and no uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography. These findings are consistent with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). AIS is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to respond to androgens, the male sex hormones.

Therefore, the answer is: E", "E: Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient is experiencing blood loss from the lacerations, which leads to a decrease in blood volume and a decrease in blood pressure. In response to the decreased blood pressure, the baroreceptors in the carotid arteries and aortic arch sense the decrease and send signals to the brainstem. The brainstem then sends signals to the sympathetic nervous system, which causes the release of norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node. Norepinephrine increases the heart rate and contractility and causes vasoconstriction, which helps to increase blood pressure. Therefore, the most likely process seen in this patient would be increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node.", "B: Chemoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is the most likely process to be seen in this patient. Chemoreceptors are located in the carotid bodies and aortic bodies and respond to changes in blood pH, PaCO2, and PaO2. When blood pressure decreases, chemoreceptors sense the decrease in blood pressure and send signals to the brainstem, which triggers vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction helps to increase blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Baroreceptor-mediated vasodilation is the most likely process to be seen in this patient because it is a compensatory mechanism that occurs in response to decreased blood pressure. When blood pressure decreases, the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch sense the decrease in pressure and send signals to the brain. The brain then responds by causing vasodilation, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance and increases blood flow to the tissues. This helps to restore blood pressure to normal levels.

She is taking unfractionated heparin, which is an anticoagulant medication that can cause bleeding complications. Heparin anticoagulation directly inhibits thrombin, inactivating it and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Heparin also increases the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin III, which inactivates factor Xa and thrombin. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is excess circulating thrombin. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. This can occur as a result of interactions between warfarin and certain antibiotics, such as fluoxetine. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including factor II, VII, IX, and X. Fluoxetine can inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. The patient's symptoms, including bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters, severe right leg pain, and hematomas, are consistent with bleeding due to a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms because she is taking prophylactic unfractionated heparin, which can cause a decrease in the activity of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, such as factors II, VII, IX, and X.

The patient's symptoms, which include bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters, severe right leg pain, and multiple hematomas, are consistent with a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Heparin, a widely used anticoagulant, potentiates inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including factor II, VII, IX, and X. A deficiency of these clotting factors can lead to prolonged bleeding times and the formation of hematomas. The patient's symptoms, such as the bluish discolorations around the intravenous catheters and hematomas on the upper extremities, are consistent with a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has bruising and hematomas around the intravenous access sites, severe right leg pain, and thrombocytopenia.

[240, "Question: A 26-year-old female complains of frequent, large volume urination. This negatively affects her sleep, as she has to frequently wake up at night to urinate. She also complains of increased thirst. Her past medical history is significant for bipolar disorder that is treated with lithium for 3 years. Serum osmolality is 425 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality is 176 mOsm/kg. Which of the following best explains this patient’s serum and urine osmolality?\nOptions: A: Hypothalamic over-production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)\tB: Decreased production of ADH\tC: ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts\tD: Increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion\tE: Increased aquaporin expression in the renal collecting ducts", "C", ["The patient has polyuria and increased thirst, which are classic symptoms of diabetes insipidus (DI). DI is characterized by decreased production or action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to impaired water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine and increased thirst. Lithium, a commonly used medication for bipolar disorder, can cause DI by inhibiting the release of ADH. Therefore, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to lithium-induced DI. The serum osmolality is high and the urine osmolality is low, indicating that the kidneys are not concentrating urine appropriately. This is consistent with DI. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has a high serum osmolality and a low urine osmolality. This suggests that the patient is unable to concentrate her urine, which is consistent with diabetes insipidus. Lithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder, and it can cause diabetes insipidus by inhibiting the release of ADH. ADH is a hormone that helps the kidneys retain water, so its inhibition leads to the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has increased serum osmolality and decreased urine osmolality. This suggests that the kidneys are not able to concentrate urine, which is consistent with ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts. ADH resistance can be caused by a number of factors, including lithium, which is a known side effect of bipolar disorder treatment. Therefore, the answer is: C", "In the collecting ducts of the kidneys, ADH binds to receptors on the epithelial cells, which activates aquaporins, allowing for the reabsorption of water from the urine back into the blood. In the absence of ADH, the collecting ducts are impermeable to water, resulting in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. In this patient, the low urine osmolality (176 mOsm/kg) indicates that the urine is dilute, suggesting that the kidneys are not effectively reabsorbing water. The elevated serum osmolality (425 mOsm/kg) suggests that the body is attempting to conserve water. Lithium is known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition in which the kidneys are resistant to the effects of ADH. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine and can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient has a high serum osmolality and a low urine osmolality. This suggests that the kidneys are not able to concentrate the urine, despite the high serum osmolality. This is consistent with ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts.

There are several types of albinism, including oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), which affects the skin, hair, and eyes, and ocular albinism (OA), which affects only the eyes. The most common type of OCA is OCA1, which is caused by mutations in the TYR gene. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The most likely diagnosis is albinism because it is a condition characterized by the absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. Melanocytes are cells that produce melanin, a pigment that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. In albinism, the body does not produce melanin, resulting in hypopigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes. Therefore, the answer is: B.", "Albinism is a group of genetic disorders that result in the complete or partial absence of the pigment melanin in the skin, hair, and eyes.

The patient's serum bicarbonate is 31 mEq/L, which is within normal limits. Renal tubular acidosis type I is caused by a defect in the proximal tubule that results in the loss of bicarbonate and hydrogen ions in the urine. This leads to a metabolic acidosis and a decrease in serum bicarbonate. Renal tubular acidosis type II is caused by a defect in the distal tubule that results in the loss of bicarbonate and potassium in the urine. This also leads to a metabolic acidosis and a decrease in serum bicarbonate. Renal tubular acidosis type IV is caused by a defect in the collecting duct that results in the loss of bicarbonate and sodium in the urine. This leads to a metabolic alkalosis and an increase in serum bicarbonate. The patient's serum bicarbonate is within normal limits, so he does not have renal tubular acidosis type I, type II, or type IV. The patient is taking lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, and metformin, a biguanide. Both of these medications can cause renal tubular acidosis. Therefore, the best explanation of this patient's current presentation is renal tubular acidosis caused by lisinopril and metformin.

Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has a high serum sodium concentration (154 mEq/L) and dry skin and mucous membranes on physical exam, suggesting hypernatremia. This is likely due to excessive drainage output, which has resulted in fluid loss and dehydration. The best next step in management is to replace the fluid and electrolytes that have been lost. 0.45% saline IV is the best choice because it will provide both water and sodium, which are the fluids and electrolytes that are most depleted. 0.9% saline IV would be inappropriate because it would further increase the patient's serum sodium concentration. 5% dextrose IV would not provide any sodium, which is the electrolyte that is most depleted. 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV would be an appropriate choice, but it is not the best choice because it would provide less sodium than 0.45% saline IV alone. Oral free water replacement would not be effective because the patient is difficult to arouse and may not be able to drink fluids orally. Therefore, the answer is: A", "0.45% saline IV is the best next step in management. The patient has hypernatremia, which is a serum sodium level greater than 145 mEq/L.

This patient has a small penis and difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. These findings suggest Kallmann syndrome, which is an X-linked disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the KAL1 gene. This expansion leads to the loss of function of the KAL1 protein, which is necessary for the development of the olfactory bulbs and the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH is a hormone that stimulates the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are necessary for the development of puberty. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell, which suggests that he has Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome is caused by mutations in genes involved in the development of the hypothalamus and olfactory system.

Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell, which suggests Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH are necessary for the development of the sex organs and the production of sex hormones. In Kallmann syndrome, the hypothalamus does not produce enough GnRH, which leads to a deficiency of LH and FSH. This results in delayed or absent puberty and infertility. The expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the X-linked KAL1 gene is the most common cause of Kallmann syndrome. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient is a 17-year-old boy with Tanner stage 1 and a decreased sense of smell. The combination of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and anosmia suggests a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome is caused by mutations in genes that regulate the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and the olfactory system. In this case, the patient likely has a mutation in the KAL1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in neuronal migration and axonal guidance.

Synovial fluid aspiration shows cloudy, dense yellow fluid with 30,000 cells/µL and needle-shaped birefringent crystals. These findings are consistent with gout. Gout is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. The crystals are formed when uric acid levels in the blood are high. Uric acid is a waste product that is produced when the body breaks down purines, which are found in some foods and are also produced by the body. Gout is treated with medications that lower uric acid levels in the blood. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient has a history of smoking and alcohol abuse, which are risk factors for gout. He also has a swollen, tender, erythematous right first metatarsophalangeal joint. The joint aspirate shows elevated WBC count and needle-shaped birefringent crystals. These findings suggest gouty arthritis, which is a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints. The crystals can be seen in the joint aspirate under a microscope. The most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is increased renal reabsorption of urate. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has a swollen, warm, and red toe joint with severe pain. The joint fluid is cloudy, dense yellow, and contains needle-shaped birefringent crystals. This is consistent with a gout attack. Gout is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. The crystals are formed when uric acid, a waste product of purine metabolism, reaches high levels in the blood. High levels of uric acid can be caused by a number of factors, including a high-purine diet, decreased renal excretion of uric acid, and increased cell turnover. Therefore, the answer is: E", "Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. These are likely to be monosodium urate crystals, which are typically seen in gout. Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism that results in elevated levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). Uric acid is a byproduct of purine catabolism. In gout, uric acid can form crystals that deposit in the joints, causing inflammation and pain. The most common joint affected by gout is the first metatarsophalangeal joint (the big toe). Therefore, the answer is: C", "The synovial fluid aspirate from the patient's right first metatarsophalangeal joint shows cloudy, dense yellow appearance, 30,000 WBC/µL, and needle-shaped birefringent crystals. These findings are consistent with gouty arthritis, which is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. Gouty arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that is characterized by sudden, severe pain, swelling, and redness in the joints, most commonly the big toe. The most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is increased renal reabsorption of urate. This can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, certain medications (such as diuretics and aspirin), and kidney disease. Therefore, the answer is: B"]]

He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge.

Penicillins act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis in bacteria by binding to the transpeptidase enzyme that cross-links the cell wall components. This results in the production of target cells, which are bacteria with abnormal cell walls. Therefore, the answer is: C", "50S ribosome inhibitor is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case. Target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis are all signs of increased erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis is the process by which red blood cells are produced. 50S ribosome inhibitors are drugs that inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of the ribosome. This inhibition of protein synthesis can lead to an increase in erythropoiesis, which can result in the production of target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has severe trauma, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy is begun. Thrombocytosis and leukocytosis are consistent with the stress response and do not indicate development of infection. Thus, the most likely drug prescribed is a prophylactic antibiotic. Prophylactic antibiotics in this case are typically broad-spectrum and are designed to prevent infection. Penicillin is an antibiotic that inhibits synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Penicillin will target bacteria that are undergoing active multiplication. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient has target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis, which are all signs of ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineffective erythropoiesis occurs when the bone marrow produces red blood cells that are not able to mature properly. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, inflammation, and certain drugs. The drug that is most likely to cause ineffective erythropoiesis is a folate metabolism inhibitor. Folate is an essential nutrient that is required for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Folate metabolism inhibitors block the synthesis of folate, which can lead to the production of abnormal red blood cells. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has severe internal bleeding due to trauma and underwent surgery to remove severely damaged tissues. After surgery, he developed target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. These findings are consistent with post-splenectomy syndrome, which is a condition that can occur after the removal of the spleen. The spleen plays an important role in the removal of old or damaged red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells from the bloodstream. After splenectomy, these cells can accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to the development of target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. Prophylactic antibiotics are typically prescribed to prevent infection in patients with post-splenectomy syndrome. Therefore, the answer is: C"]]

[274, "Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques.

It is often triggered by stress, smoking, or alcohol consumption. The pain typically resolves within minutes and is relieved by nitrates. In this case, the patient's chest pain occurred after a stressful day at work and alcohol consumption, and it resolved spontaneously within 30 minutes. The ECG changes also support the diagnosis of vasospasm. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Coronary artery vasospasm is a temporary constriction of the coronary arteries, which can reduce blood flow to the heart muscle and cause chest pain. It is often triggered by stress or alcohol consumption. Atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing is a narrowing of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque, which can also reduce blood flow to the heart muscle and cause chest pain. However, in this case, the patient's chest pain resolved spontaneously and a repeat ECG showed no abnormalities, which suggests that it was most likely caused by coronary artery vasospasm.

Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient is a 15-year-old girl with secondary amenorrhea. She has a history of irregular menses, obesity, and a manic episode. Her mother has PCOS. Examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Serum hormone studies show elevated prolactin, normal TSH, low progesterone, and normal testosterone. These findings suggest that the most likely cause of her symptoms is hyperprolactinemia due to risperidone, which is a dopamine antagonist. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion, so blocking dopamine receptors with risperidone can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia can cause amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has secondary amenorrhea, which means that she has had regular menstrual bleeding in the past but has not had any for 3 months. She has a history of a manic episode, which was treated with risperidone. Risperidone is an antipsychotic medication that can cause hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to amenorrhea. The patient also has a BMI of 27.02 kg/m2, which is in the overweight range. Obesity can also lead to amenorrhea. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia and obesity-related anovulation.

[355, "Question: A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of thrombophlebitis. Physical examination shows multiple bruises on her limbs. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?\nOptions: A: Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation\tB: Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin\tC: Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis\tD: Inhibition of stem cell differentiation\tE: Restoration of the body's iron stores", "B", ["The mechanism most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of the drug in sickle cell disease is inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder in which the body produces abnormal hemoglobin. This abnormal hemoglobin can cause red blood cells to assume a sickle shape, which can lead to blockages in small blood vessels. Platelets are involved in the formation of blood clots, and their aggregation can contribute to the formation of these blockages. By inhibiting platelet aggregation, the drug can help to prevent the formation of these blockages and improve blood flow. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The drug that is used in the treatment of sickle cell disease and is also used in the treatment of the patient's condition is hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in red blood cells. HbF is a type of hemoglobin that is normally produced during fetal development and infancy, but its production typically decreases after birth. HbF has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbA), which means that it releases oxygen more readily to tissues. This can help to prevent the sickling of red blood cells and the associated complications of sickle cell disease, such as pain, tissue damage, and stroke. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The medication is likely hydroxyurea, which is used to treat both thrombocytosis and sickle cell disease. In sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin, which has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. This helps to prevent the sickling of red blood cells and the associated complications of sickle cell disease. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The drug is likely hydroxyurea, which is used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbA) and prevents the sickling of red blood cells. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The drug is hydroxyurea, which is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea inhibits the formation of deoxyribonucleotides, which are required for DNA synthesis. This results in an increase in the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is a more soluble form of hemoglobin and is less likely to polymerize and cause sickling of red blood cells. Therefore, the answer is: B"]]

Therefore, the answer is: C", "Beta-1 adrenergic receptor is the correct answer. Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are located in the heart and are responsible for increasing heart rate and contractility. Stimulation of these receptors can improve the hemodynamic status of a patient in cardiac arrest by increasing cardiac output. Therefore, a medication that primarily stimulates beta-1 adrenergic receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient.", "Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are primarily located in the heart. Stimulation of these receptors increases the force and rate of myocardial contraction. In this patient, who is experiencing a myocardial infarction, stimulation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors would help to improve her hemodynamic status by increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Therefore, the answer is: C", "Dopamine primarily stimulates D1 and D2 receptors. Stimulation of D1 receptors in the heart increases myocardial contractility and heart rate. Therefore, dopamine would be the most appropriate medication to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient. Therefore, the answer is: E"]]
[364, "Question: A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?\nOptions: A: Indomethacin +/- omeprazole\tB: Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole\tC: Prednisone + colchicine\tD: Pericardiocentesis\tE: Pericardiectomy", "B", ["The ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads V2-V4 and ST depression in leads II, III and aVF. These are consistent with acute pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart. The patient has chest pain that is sharp, severe, constant, and unrelated to exertion. The pain is worse when lying down and improves with leaning forward. These are all characteristic symptoms of acute pericarditis. The scratching sound audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward is a pericardial friction rub. This is a classic sign of acute pericarditis. The optimal therapy for acute pericarditis is indomethacin +/- omeprazole. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces stomach acid production and helps to prevent stomach ulcers, which can be a side effect of NSAIDs. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The ECG shows PR segment elevation, which is a classic sign of pericarditis. The patient has sharp, severe chest pain that increases when lying down and improves with leaning forward, which is also suggestive of pericarditis. The optimal therapy for acute pericarditis is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or indomethacin, with or without colchicine. Omeprazole may be added to help prevent NSAID-induced gastritis. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The optimal therapy for this patient is ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole because the ECG shows PR segment elevation, ST segment depression, and T wave inversion in leads V1-V3, consistent with pericarditis. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart. The most common cause of pericarditis is a viral infection, such as the common cold or flu. Other causes of pericarditis include autoimmune disorders, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, and certain medications, such as chemotherapy drugs or antibiotics. The symptoms of pericarditis include chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The diagnosis of pericarditis is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and ECG findings. Treatment for pericarditis typically includes anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen or colchicine. In some cases, pericardiocentesis, a procedure to remove fluid from the pericardium, may be necessary. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V1, V2, V3, and V4a, consistent with acute pericarditis. Indomethacin +/- omeprazole is the optimal therapy for this patient because it is an effective anti-inflammatory agent that can relieve the pain and inflammation of pericarditis. Omeprazole is added to protect the stomach from potential side effects of indomethacin. Ibuprofen can also be used, but it is less effective than indomethacin. Colchicine can be added to either indomethacin or ibuprofen to prevent recurrent pericarditis. Prednisone can be used, but it is less preferred than indomethacin or ibuprofen because it can cause more side effects. Pericardiocentesis and pericardiectomy are invasive procedures that are reserved for patients with severe pericarditis that does not respond to medical therapy. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has a pericardial friction rub and a normal chest x-ray. The condition is consistent with acute pericarditis. Therefore, the answer is: A"]]

These findings suggest post-transfusion hepatitis B. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes. She had a recent history of surgery in Haiti and received a blood transfusion during the surgery. She is positive for anti-HAV IgG and has massive centrilobular necrosis on liver biopsy. These findings suggest that she has hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver that is spread through contact with contaminated food or water. The virus can also be spread through blood transfusions. The incubation period for hepatitis A is typically 15–50 days. Symptoms of hepatitis A include jaundice, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Liver biopsy can show massive centrilobular necrosis. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has massive centrilobular necrosis of the liver, which is most likely caused by yellow fever. Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic infection transmitted by mosquitoes. It is found in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa and South America. The virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. The disease usually begins 3 to 6 days after the mosquito bite. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, and nausea. In some cases, the disease can progress to a more severe form, known as hemorrhagic fever, which can lead to death. The diagnosis of yellow fever is based on the patient's history and physical examination. Laboratory studies can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive and includes rest, fluids, and pain relievers. There is no specific antiviral treatment for yellow fever.

Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue is found outside the uterine cavity. This tissue can implant on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, peritoneum, and other organs in the pelvic and abdominal cavities. During menstruation, this ectopic endometrial tissue breaks down and bleeds, causing inflammation, pain, and scarring. The pain is typically worse during menstruation and can be accompanied by diarrhea, constipation, and urinary problems. Endometriosis can also cause infertility by blocking the fallopian tubes or preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient has episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea for 5 years, which suggests endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue grows outside the uterine cavity. This can cause pain, infertility, and other symptoms.

Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has a continuous murmur at the left upper sternal border. This is the location of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The PDA is a congenital heart defect in which the ductus arteriosus, a blood vessel that connects the aorta and pulmonary artery during fetal development, fails to close after birth. This allows blood to flow from the aorta, which carries oxygenated blood, into the pulmonary artery, which carries deoxygenated blood. This can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs and heart failure. The most appropriate treatment for a PDA is indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause closure of the ductus arteriosus. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has a continuous murmur at the left upper sternal border, which is consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is a congenital heart defect in which the ductus arteriosus, a fetal blood vessel that connects the aorta and pulmonary artery, fails to close after birth. This can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, which can cause heart failure. The treatment of PDA depends on the size of the defect and the severity of the symptoms. In this case, the patient is 2 days old and has a continuous murmur, which suggests that the PDA is large. The most appropriate treatment is indomethacin, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can help to close the PDA. Therefore, the answer is: A"]]

These findings suggest tetralogy of Fallot, which is a congenital heart defect that consists of four defects: pulmonary stenosis, an overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The overriding aorta allows some oxygenated blood to reach the systemic circulation, which is why the newborn is cyanotic. The single loud S2 heart sound is caused by the pulmonary stenosis. The \"egg-shaped\" heart is caused by the right ventricular hypertrophy. The atrial septostomy is a temporary measure to alleviate the cyanosis until the newborn can undergo definitive surgical correction. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The symptoms and signs indicate that the newborn has transposition of great vessels, a congenital heart defect in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. This results in deoxygenated blood being pumped to the body and oxygenated blood being pumped to the lungs. The single loud S2 heart sound is due to the presence of a single semilunar valve (the pulmonary valve). The machine-like murmur is due to the increased blood flow across the pulmonary valve. The enlarged \"egg-shaped\" heart is due to the enlarged right ventricle and the small left ventricle. The atrial septostomy is performed to create a communication between the atria, which allows some oxygenated blood from the right atrium to mix with the deoxygenated blood in the left atrium. This improves the oxygen saturation of the blood. Definitive surgical correction involves switching the positions of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Tetralogy of Fallot is the most likely cause of this newborn's condition. It is a cyanotic congenital heart defect characterized by four abnormalities: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The overriding aorta allows deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to mix with oxygenated blood from the left ventricle and be pumped out to the body, causing cyanosis. The pulmonary stenosis obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs, leading to progressive respiratory failure. The enlarged \"egg-shaped\" heart on radiography is due to the right ventricular hypertrophy. The loud S2 heart sound is due to the pulmonary stenosis, and the machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border is due to the ventricular septal defect. Atrial septostomy is a palliative procedure that creates an opening between the atria to increase blood flow to the lungs and alleviate cyanosis. Definitive surgical correction involves repairing the ventricular septal defect, relieving the pulmonary stenosis, and repositioning the aorta to its normal position.

Therefore, the answer is: D", "Warfarin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. These factors are necessary for the formation of blood clots. By inhibiting the production of these factors, warfarin makes it more difficult for blood clots to form. This can help to prevent strokes and other thromboembolic events. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate. The goal of treatment is to prevent thromboembolism. Anticoagulation with warfarin is often used for this purpose. Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, such as factor II (prothrombin), factor VII, factor IX, and factor X. This makes it more difficult for the blood to clot. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat caused by disorganized electrical signals in the heart's upper chambers (atria). The goal of anticoagulation is to prevent blood clots from forming in the heart and traveling to the brain, causing a stroke. In atrial fibrillation, the blood does not flow smoothly through the atrium, increasing the risk of clotting. The new medication will inhibit vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which are necessary for the formation of blood clots. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is a type of arrhythmia in which the heart beats irregularly and rapidly. Atrial fibrillation can lead to blood clots forming in the heart, increasing the risk of stroke. Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication that works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver.

Tetanolysin, another toxin produced by C tetani, destroys anterior horn cells and may cause permanent damage. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Tetanus is caused by the exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani, which is a gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium. The exotoxin is a protease that inhibits the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), from presynaptic neurons. This results in increased muscle tone and spasms. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Tetrodotoxin (TTX) from C. botulinum blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in excitable cells. A presynaptic effect at the neuromuscular junction inhibits acetylcholine release and thus also motor function. Neurons of sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are also affected which accounts for the pupillary dilation, tachycardia, and ileus. Cranial nerves are equally affected and this accounts for the ptosis and dysphagia. However, the neuromuscular paralysis seen with neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and with C. botulinum infection is different in that, in C. botulinum poisoning, there is usually no muscular weakness or atrophy and the tendon reflexes are typically preserved. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Tetanus is a disease caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The bacterium produces a toxin that inhibits the release of glycine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the control of muscle tone. This results in muscle spasms, which can be severe and lead to death. The pathogenesis of tetanus is therefore characterized by decreased release of glycine. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient has sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump. These findings suggest tetanus neonatorum. Tetanus toxin inhibits the release of glycine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. This inhibition of glycine release results in increased muscle spasms and rigidity.

These findings are consistent with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, which is a type of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This leads to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. In Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, the weakness is most severe in the proximal muscles, such as the shoulders and thighs. The deep tendon reflexes are also decreased or absent. The bell-shaped chest is a result of the weakness of the intercostal muscles. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and a bell-shaped chest. These findings suggest a neuromuscular disorder. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is decreased acetylcholine receptor density. This can be caused by a congenital myasthenic syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and a bell-shaped chest. This suggests a neuromuscular disorder, specifically a lower motor neuron disorder. Anterior horn cell degeneration is a condition in which the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord degenerate. This can lead to muscle weakness, atrophy, and paralysis. Axonal demyelination, decreased acetylcholine receptor density, impaired acetylcholine release, and myonecrosis can all cause muscle weakness, but they do not typically cause the other symptoms that the patient has, such as diminished deep tendon reflexes and a bell-shaped chest. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities, diminished deep tendon reflexes, a bell-shaped chest, and a weak cry and suck. These findings suggest a neuromuscular disorder. The patient is also 6 months old, which is the age at which symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) typically start to appear. SMA is a genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord. These motor neurons are responsible for sending signals from the brain to the muscles. In SMA, the motor neurons are either lost or damaged, which leads to weakness and atrophy of the muscles. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is SMA. Therefore, the answer is: A"]]

These findings are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the synovial membrane of the joints becomes inflamed and thickened, leading to pain, swelling, and stiffness. The inflammation can also cause damage to the cartilage and bone, leading to narrowing of the joint space and spurring of the bones. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient is a 27-year-old man who presents with left shoulder pain that worsens when he tries to sleep on his left side. He has tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint and biceps tendon tenderness.

This can lead to sudden, painless loss of vision in the affected eye. The retina appears pale and white on fundoscopic examination, with a cherry-red spot in the macula. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The most likely diagnosis is central retinal artery occlusion. This is a sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye that is caused by a blockage of the central retinal artery, which supplies blood to the retina. The blockage can be caused by a blood clot, a piece of plaque from an atherosclerotic artery, or an embolus from the heart. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which are risk factors for central retinal artery occlusion. The sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye, the absence of direct pupillary reflex in the right eye, and the pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula on fundoscopic examination are all consistent with central retinal artery occlusion. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The woman has sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye with a pale, white retina and a bright red area within the macula. This is consistent with central retinal artery occlusion, which is a blockage of the main artery that supplies blood to the retina. This can lead to loss of vision in the affected eye. The other options are less likely because they do not explain the sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye. Therefore, the answer is: C"]]

Phosphoprotein p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Inactivation of p53 can lead to the development of cancer. In carcinoma-in-situ, p53 is often mutated or inactivated, which allows cells with DNA damage to survive and proliferate. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Phosphoprotein p53 is activated in response to DNA damage. When DNA is damaged, p53 is phosphorylated and forms a complex with other proteins, such as MDM2, to halt the cell cycle and allow time for DNA repair. If the damage is too severe to be repaired, p53 triggers apoptosis, or cell death. In cancer cells, p53 is often mutated or inactivated, which allows the cells to continue to divide and proliferate, leading to the development of cancer. In the case of cervical cancer, infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to the inactivation of p53, which allows the development of carcinoma-in-situ and, eventually, invasive cervical cancer.

This is the preferred method of treatment for esophageal tears, as it allows for quick hemostasis and can be performed emergently. Conservative management is not appropriate, as the patient is still at risk for further bleeding. Barium swallow and esophageal manometry are not indicated, as they will not help to treat the tear. Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection are not appropriate, as they will not stop the bleeding. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The next best course of action is conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation. The patient is hemodynamically stable, and the esophageal tear is small and not actively bleeding. Conservative management is appropriate in this case, as it is less invasive and has a lower risk of complications. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding, IV fluid hydration, and NPO is the next best course of action. Endoscopic injection and ligation will approximate the torn mucosal edges, while banding will reinforce the closure. IV fluid hydration will help to replace lost fluids and electrolytes, and NPO will allow the esophageal tear to heal. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The next best course of action is conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation. The patient has a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. This type of tear is usually managed conservatively with IV fluid hydration and observation.

Therefore, the answer is: Ethanol is a depressant, but it can be used to treat alcohol intoxication. Ethanol competitively inhibits the effects of alcohol on the central nervous system. This can help to reduce the severity of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient is intoxicated with methanol, evidenced by the elevated anion gap, decreased bicarbonate, low serum osmolality, and the presence of formic acid on urinalysis. Treatment should focus on correcting the anion gap and minimizing the formation of toxic metabolites. Fomepizole is the antidote of choice for methanol poisoning and should be administered next.

Therefore, the answer is: C", "The image shows a left-sided epidural hematoma. The most likely etiology of this patient’s condition is tearing of the middle meningeal artery. The middle meningeal artery is a branch of the maxillary artery that supplies blood to the dura mater. It is commonly injured in head trauma, resulting in an epidural hematoma. Epidural hematomas are characterized by a rapidly expanding collection of blood between the dura mater and the skull. They can cause a rapid decline in consciousness and death if not promptly treated. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The image shows a CT scan of the head showing a large epidural hematoma on the left side. This is most likely due to tearing of the middle meningeal artery, which is a common cause of epidural hematomas. The middle meningeal artery is located between the skull and the dura mater, and it can be torn by a blow to the head.

[486, "Question: Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab.

The PIP joints are more likely to be involved in chronic inflammation, such as the pain that the patient has been experiencing for several years, which would lead to an increase in monocytes and a decrease in neutrophils. Therefore, the answer is: C", "DIP has more neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP. Neutrophils and monocytes are white blood cells that are present in the joints in response to inflammation. DIP joints are more likely to be inflamed than PIP joints in this patient because they were recently injured. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The DIP joint is more likely to have more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than the PIP joint. The DIP joint is more superficial and is therefore more likely to be injured. Neutrophils are the first cells to arrive at a site of injury, and they phagocytize foreign material and release inflammatory mediators. Monocytes are also involved in the inflammatory response, but they arrive later than neutrophils. Therefore, the answer is: C", "DIP has fewer neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP. The DIP joint is closer to the site of the laceration and therefore has more inflammation. The PIP joint is further away from the site of the laceration and therefore has less inflammation. Neutrophils are the first cells to arrive at the site of inflammation and are responsible for killing bacteria. Monocytes are macrophages that arrive later and help to clear away debris. Therefore, the answer is: B", "DIP has fewer neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP.

Paramedics arrive quickly, and he is taken to the hospital where several stable lumbar fractures and a shattered right calcaneus are found. He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws. Which of the following statements best describes the long term post-surgery outcome in this patient?\nOptions: A: He will not be able to plantar flex his foot.\tB: He will not be able to point his toe.\tC: He will have a foot drop.\tD: He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.\tE: He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot.", "D", ["The peroneal nerve runs through a canal behind the fibula and it innervates the peroneus longus and brevis muscles. The calcaneus insertion is directly posterior to the peroneal nerve, and calcaneal surgery can result in injury to the peroneal nerve. This can cause a foot drop, which is an inability to dorsiflex the foot. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The calcaneus is the largest bone in the foot. It is located in the heel and helps to support the arch of the foot. A shattered calcaneus is a serious injury that can lead to long-term problems, including pain, stiffness, and difficulty walking.

This surgery may help to improve his long-term outcome, but it is likely that he will still have some pain and difficulty walking. He may also have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot, which are movements that involve turning the foot inward and outward. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The shattered right calcaneus was repaired with 11 screws. The calcaneus is the heel bone and it is responsible for plantar flexion of the foot. Plantar flexion is the downward movement of the foot. Therefore, the patient will not be able to plantar flex his foot. Therefore, the answer is: A", "After a calcaneus fracture, the patient may have pain with inversion and eversion of the foot. Inversion and eversion are movements that involve the turning of the foot inward and outward, respectively.

[505, "Question: An elderly man presents to his physician with complaints of difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling which began 2 months ago. His breathlessness worsens while walking, climbing the stairs, and lying flat on his back. He also finds it difficult to sleep well at night, as he often wakes up to catch his breath. His pulse is 98/min and blood pressure is 114/90 mm Hg. On examination, he has mild respiratory distress, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema is evident on the lower third of his legs. His respiratory rate is 33/min, SpO2 is 93% in room air, and coarse crepitations are heard over the lung bases. On auscultation, the P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex. Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?\nOptions: A: Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential\tB: Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient\tC: Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels\tD: Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption\tE: Reduction in myocardial contractility", "B", ["The patient has symptoms and signs of heart failure, including shortness of breath, fatigue, bilateral leg swelling, and orthopnea. He also has an elevated respiratory rate and coarse crepitations in the lungs. Auscultation of the heart reveals an S3 gallop rhythm and a loud P2 component of the second heart sound, which suggests pulmonary hypertension. The patient was prescribed medication that resulted in a decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential. This suggests that the medication is a calcium channel blocker, which inhibits the influx of calcium ions into the heart muscle cells. This decreases the force of myocardial contraction and reduces the heart rate, which can improve symptoms of heart failure. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The mechanism of action of the prescribed medication is preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels. This is evident from the fact that the medication causes a decrease in the end-diastolic pressure and an increase in the end-diastolic volume, which suggests that the capacitance vessels have been dilated. This would allow for more blood to be accommodated in the venous system, thereby reducing the symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The labeled loop shows that the prescribed medication reduces the slope of the pacemaker potential by slowing the automaticity of the pacemaker nodal cells in the heart. This can be seen in the shallower pacemaker potential depicted with the dashed blue line after medication. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The mechanism of action of the prescribed medication is inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption. Aldosterone is a hormone that promotes sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, which leads to increased water retention and fluid volume. By inhibiting aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption, the medication reduces fluid retention and improves symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema. This is reflected in the decreased ventricular preload and afterload, resulting in a reduced peak filling pressure. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The prescribed medication causes a decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential.

Within the first 24 hours after birth, the newborn develops fever and a yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae. Examination shows loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis. Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?\nOptions: A: Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione\tB: Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen\tC: Point mutation in β-globin\tD: Deficiency of ATP\tE: Osmotically fragile erythrocytes", "D", ["The photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear shows evidence of erythrophagocytosis, which is the phagocytosis of red blood cells by macrophages. This suggests that the patient has autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys its own red blood cells. The maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen are likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition because they are directed against the rhesus D antigen on the surface of the red blood cells. This can lead to the destruction of the red blood cells and the development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has kernicterus, a condition characterized by bilirubin encephalopathy. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced when hemoglobin is broken down. It is normally excreted in the bile, but in some cases, it can accumulate in the blood and cause jaundice. In kernicterus, bilirubin accumulates in the brain, causing damage to the basal ganglia and other areas of the brain. The most common cause of kernicterus is Rh incompatibility, which occurs when a mother is Rh-negative and her baby is Rh-positive. The mother's immune system produces antibodies against the Rh-positive blood cells, which can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. This can lead to hemolytic anemia, which is the destruction of red blood cells. The breakdown of red blood cells releases bilirubin into the bloodstream, which can then accumulate in the brain and cause kernicterus. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear shows RBC spherocytes, which are small, round, rigid red blood cells. Spherocytes are characteristic of hemolytic anemia caused by autoimmune disorders, such as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA). In WAIHA, the patient's immune system produces antibodies against their own red blood cells, leading to their destruction. The destruction of red blood cells can cause a number of symptoms, including fever, jaundice, splenomegaly, cyanosis, and decreased haptoglobin levels. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The photomicrograph shows the presence of spherocytes, which are erythrocytes with a round, rather than biconcave, morphology. This suggests that the patient has hereditary spherocytosis, a condition in which the erythrocytes are abnormally spherical and fragile. Spherocytes are more easily destroyed by the spleen than normal erythrocytes, leading to anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. The decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels are also consistent with hereditary spherocytosis. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The photomicrograph shows spherocytes, which are red blood cells that have a spherical shape instead of the normal biconcave shape. Spherocytes are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis, an inherited disorder in which the red blood cells are abnormally fragile and are destroyed prematurely.

Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition. β-catenin is a protein that plays a role in cell adhesion and signaling. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), which targets it for degradation. When Wnt signaling is activated, β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated by GSK-3β, and it accumulates in the cytoplasm. This accumulation of β-catenin leads to its translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to transcription factors and activates the transcription of genes that promote cell growth and proliferation. In colon cancer, mutations in the APC gene, which encodes a protein that helps to regulate β-catenin degradation, can lead to the accumulation of β-catenin and the activation of Wnt signaling, which can promote tumor growth. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The photomicrograph shows a biopsy specimen of a sessile serrated adenoma. Sessile serrated adenomas are characterized by the presence of dysplastic serrated crypts, which are crypts with a sawtooth-like appearance. The pathogenesis of serrated adenomas involves the activation of the WNT pathway, which leads to impaired degradation of β-catenin. β-catenin is a protein that plays a role in cell growth and differentiation. Impaired degradation of β-catenin leads to its accumulation in the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The photomicrograph shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon.

[513, "Question: A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia.

Prions can be transmitted through contact with brain tissue or spinal fluid, or through the ingestion of contaminated food. CJD can be sporadic, inherited, or acquired. Sporadic CJD is the most common form, and it occurs in people with no known risk factors. Inherited CJD is caused by a mutation in the PRNP gene, which codes for the prion protein. Acquired CJD can be transmitted through contact with contaminated medical equipment, blood transfusions, or organ transplantation.

[524, "Question: A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air during a recent hike with his friends. He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?\nOptions: A: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system\tB: Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system\tC: Arachidonic acid system\tD: Phosphoinositol system\tE: Tyrosine kinase system", "D", ["Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that works by blocking the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the lungs. This results in a decrease in the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which leads to bronchodilation. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Ipratropium bromide is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic cholinoreceptors, which are located in the airways. Muscarinic cholinoreceptors are coupled to the phospholipase C-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) pathway. When ipratropium bromide binds to the muscarinic cholinoreceptors, it blocks the activation of phospholipase C, which inhibits the production of IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). As a result, the intracellular calcium concentration decreases, leading to relaxation of airway smooth muscle and bronchodilation. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Ipratropium bromide is a short-acting anticholinergic agent that blocks the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the airways, leading to bronchodilation. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors are coupled to the Gq protein, which activates phospholipase C and generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 causes the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores, while DAG activates protein kinase C. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Ipratropium bromide is a short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that works by blocking the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways, leading to bronchodilation.

DAG activates protein kinase C, while IP3 causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores. The increase in intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C lead to contraction of airway smooth muscle. By blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, ipratropium bromide inhibits the Gq protein-mediated signaling pathway, leading to decreased intracellular calcium and protein kinase C activity, and subsequent relaxation of airway smooth muscle.

ICAM-1 is a cell surface protein that is involved in the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. When a virus infects a cell, it can cause the downregulation of ICAM-1 expression, which prevents leukocytes from adhering to the cell and infecting it. This can help to protect the cell from infection. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome, which is characteristic of influenza virus.

In elderly individuals, the most likely change in respiratory function compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman is a decrease in residual volume. Residual volume is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiration. It decreases with age due to several factors, including decreased lung elasticity, decreased respiratory muscle strength, and increased chest wall stiffness. This decrease in residual volume can lead to an increased risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, and other respiratory complications. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The most likely change in respiratory function in this patient is decreased residual volume. As people age, the chest wall and lungs become less compliant, leading to a decrease in residual volume.

However, the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, which means that she must have had a mutation in one of her germ cells (eggs) that was not present in her somatic cells (the rest of her body). This is known as gonadal mosaicism, which is a condition in which there are two different populations of cells in the gonads (ovaries or testes). In this case, the patient's mother has one population of cells that carries the mutation and one population of cells that does not carry the mutation. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The patient's older brother and nephew have a condition that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, which means that the patient must have inherited the mutation from his father.

Incomplete penetrance is a phenomenon in which not all individuals who inherit a dominant mutation will express the associated phenotype. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The most likely explanation for the patient not being affected is incomplete penetrance. Incomplete penetrance occurs when a person carries a gene mutation but does not exhibit the associated physical characteristics or symptoms of the condition. This can happen when the gene mutation is not fully expressed or when other genetic or environmental factors influence the development of the condition. In this case, the patient's older brother and nephew have the same genetic mutation, but the patient does not. This suggests that the gene mutation is not fully penetrant in the patient's family.

In women, it is often associated with tampon use, as in this patient. The CD40 T cell receptor is involved in the activation of macrophages and other immune cells, which release cytokines that cause the symptoms of TSS, including fever, hypotension, and multiorgan failure. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The most likely condition is toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is caused by the binding and activation of the CD3 T cell receptor. The CD3 T cell receptor is a complex of proteins expressed on the surface of T cells that is responsible for recognizing and binding to antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells. Once the CD3 T cell receptor is activated, it triggers the release of cytokines and other immune mediators, which can lead to the symptoms of TSS, such as fever, altered mental status, and a petechial rash.

When CD3 is activated, it triggers a cascade of events that leads to the release of cytokines, which are molecules that help to fight infection. In the case of TSS, the cytokines released by activated T cells can cause the symptoms of the disease, such as fever, altered mental status, and a petechial rash. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The most likely condition for this patient is toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is a life-threatening bacterial infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. TSS is often associated with tampon use, especially if the tampon is left in place for more than 8 hours. The binding and activation of CD40, a T cell receptor, is responsible for the patient's condition. CD40 is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells. When CD40 is activated, it triggers the release of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which are responsible for the symptoms of TSS, including fever, altered mental status, and petechial rash. Therefore, the answer is: C"]]

[591, "Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin.

Vitamin B12 is necessary for the maturation of red blood cells, and deficiency can lead to anemia. Vitamin B12 is also important for the synthesis of myelin, and its deficiency can cause neurologic symptoms, such as burning sensation in the mouth. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the small intestine with the help of intrinsic factor, which is produced by the stomach. In pernicious anemia, there is a lack of intrinsic factor, which leads to vitamin B12 deficiency. A gluten-free diet will benefit patients with celiac disease, which can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, but the patient does not have celiac disease. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient has a history of fatigue, pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, mouth ulcers, darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles, and an enlarged spleen. Laboratory studies show anemia, microcytosis, and reticulocytosis. These findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia can cause oropharyngeal symptoms such as burning sensation in the mouth. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to provide the patient with iron replacement therapy. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has a history of fatigue, anemia, and splenomegaly. A peripheral blood smear revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones. These findings suggest hereditary spherocytosis, an inherited disorder in which red blood cells are abnormally spherical and fragile.

Spherocytosis can also cause mouth ulcers and darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. Folic acid is necessary for the production of red blood cells. Folic acid supplementation would have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has a history of fatigue and a peripheral blood smear that revealed erythrocytes without central pallor, which suggests thalassemia.

[592, "Question: A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits.

She has a fever, diaphoresis, shivering, increased tone in her bilateral upper and lower extremities, and clonus. Her basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. The most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is surreptitious opiate abuse. This is because she has a history of severe headaches and is taking ibuprofen, which can be used to mask the symptoms of opiate abuse. She is also taking an amino acid supplement, which can be used to potentiate the effects of opiates. Additionally, her low-carbohydrate diet can lead to ketosis, which can also potentiate the effects of opiates. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has severe diaphoresis, shivering, and increased muscle tone with clonus on examination. These findings are suggestive of serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when there is an excess of serotonin in the body. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including taking too much of a serotonergic medication, taking multiple serotonergic medications together, or taking a serotonergic medication with another drug that increases serotonin levels. In this patient, the most likely inciting factor for serotonin syndrome is the combination of citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and the amino acid supplement she recently started taking. Some amino acids, such as tryptophan, can increase serotonin levels in the body. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Increased tryptophan intake is the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition. Tryptophan is an amino acid that is converted to serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is involved in mood, sleep, and appetite. High levels of serotonin can cause symptoms such as fever, diaphoresis, shivering, and muscle rigidity. This patient has a history of depression and is taking citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin in the brain. The patient also recently started taking an amino acid supplement that contains tryptophan. The combination of the SSRI and the tryptophan supplement may have caused serotonin levels to become too high, leading to the patient's symptoms.

He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?\nOptions: A: Transplacental passage of thyroglobulin antibodies\tB: Transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies\tC: Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies\tD: Transplacental viral infection\tE: Opiate use in the mother", "C", ["Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies is the most likely cause of the infant's symptoms. The mother has a history of Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. TSH receptor antibodies are produced in Graves' disease and can cross the placenta to affect the fetus. These antibodies can bind to the TSH receptors in the fetal thyroid gland and stimulate the gland to produce thyroid hormone, resulting in hyperthyroidism in the fetus or newborn. Hyperthyroidism can cause poor weight gain, irritability, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The mother has hypothyroidism due to Graves' disease which was treated with surgery and L-thyroxine therapy. She is likely to produce antibodies against thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. These antibodies cross the placenta and bind to the TSH receptors on the fetal thyroid gland, resulting in hyperthyroidism in the baby. This is known as transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies. Therefore, the answer is: C", "Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies is the most likely cause of the patient's condition. TSH receptor antibodies are IgG antibodies that block the binding of TSH to its receptor on thyroid cells, resulting in hypothyroidism. These antibodies can cross the placenta and affect the fetus, causing congenital hypothyroidism. The patient's mother has a history of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs), which are antibodies that bind to the TSH receptor on thyroid cells and stimulate the production of thyroid hormones. These antibodies can cross the placenta and affect the fetus, causing neonatal Graves' disease or congenital hypothyroidism. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The most likely cause is transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies. When a mother has Graves' disease, she produces TSH receptor antibodies that cross the placenta and stimulate the fetal thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone. This causes the fetus to develop hyperthyroidism, which can lead to poor weight gain, irritability, and diaphoresis. Near-total thyroidectomy is commonly performed in the second trimester of pregnancy to minimize transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies and improve fetal outcomes. However, it is possible that some antibodies may cross the placenta before the thyroidectomy and cause hyperthyroidism in the fetus. Therefore, the answer is: C", "Transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies is the most likely cause of the infant's symptoms. Thyroid peroxidase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase can cross the placenta and bind to thyroid peroxidase in the fetal thyroid gland, interfering with thyroid hormone production. This can lead to hypothyroidism in the infant. Hypothyroidism can cause a variety of symptoms, including poor weight gain, irritability, and diaphoresis. Therefore, the answer is: B"]]

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?\nOptions: A: Decreased prostaglandin synthesis\tB: Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole\tC: Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum\tD: Decreased gastric blood flow\tE: Increased stomach acid production", "D", ["The patient has tarry black stools, hypotension, and tachycardia, which are all signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The most likely underlying cause of the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is erosion of tortuous submucosal arterioles. In burns, there is increased gastric mucosal blood flow, which can lead to the formation of tortuous submucosal arterioles. These arterioles can be eroded by gastric acid, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools is erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole because the patient had sustained burns over a large surface area of her body. This can lead to decreased blood flow to the stomach, which can cause erosion of the tortuous submucosal arterioles. This can lead to bleeding and the formation of tarry black stools. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools is erosion of tortuous submucosal arterioles. Curling's ulcer is an erosion of the gastric mucosa caused by splanchnic ischemia following burns. The most common presentation is acute gastroduodenal hemorrhage with hematemesis, melena, or a combination of both. Curling's ulcer is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in burn patients. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools. Curling's ulcers, resulting from erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole, are found in 15% to 25% of burn victims. They usually occur 24 to 48 hours after the burn injury and can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Curling's ulcers are stress ulcers that develop in the stomach and duodenum in response to severe stress, such as a burn injury. They are caused by a decrease in blood flow to the stomach and duodenum, which leads to erosion of the mucosal lining. This can lead to bleeding, which can manifest as tarry black stools. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has tarry black stools, which are indicative of upper GI bleeding. The most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools is erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole. This can occur in the setting of severe burns, as the increased blood flow to the skin can cause engorgement of the submucosal arterioles in the stomach, making them more susceptible to erosion.

Auscultation of the lungs shows coarse crackles at the right upper posterior field. An x-ray of the chest shows an opacity in the right upper lobe. Sputum analysis shows acid-fast bacilli. A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?\nOptions: A: Secretion of interferon-α\tB: Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands\tC: Opsonization by complement proteins\tD: Secretion of interleukin-4\tE: Generation of reactive oxygen species", "B", ["The correct answer is B: Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands. The tuberculin skin test is a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. It involves the interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands on antigen-presenting cells and T cells, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, the impairment of this interaction can lead to a negative tuberculin skin test, even in the presence of active tuberculosis. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has HIV, which is a risk factor for anergy, a condition in which the body does not react to skin tests or other immune challenges. Anergy is caused by impairment of the interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands, which is necessary for the activation of T cells. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The tuberculin skin test is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by T cells. The patient has a negative tuberculin skin test, which indicates that he does not have a cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Impairment of T cell function is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The patient has a positive sputum acid-fast bacilli smear, indicating active tuberculosis. However, the patient has a negative tuberculin skin test. This suggests that the patient has a defect in cell-mediated immunity, which is necessary for a positive tuberculin skin test. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that inhibits cell-mediated immunity. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The tuberculin skin test is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by T cells. In a person who has been infected with M. tuberculosis, the T cells that recognize the tuberculin antigen will proliferate and release cytokines, such as interferon-γ, which will cause inflammation and induration at the injection site. The negative tuberculin skin test in this patient indicates that the patient's T cells are not responding to the tuberculin antigen. This could be due to a number of factors, including:\n* Infection with a non-tuberculous mycobacterium\n* Immunosuppression, such as that caused by HIV infection\n* Malnutrition\n* Recent vaccination with a live vaccine, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine\n* Overwhelming tuberculosis infection\n\nIn this patient, the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test is immunosuppression caused by HIV infection.

He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, he is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. This suggests that the ductus arteriosus has closed prematurely. Closure of the ductus arteriosus is a normal process that occurs shortly after birth. However, if it occurs too early, it can lead to cyanosis and other complications. Therefore, the answer is: B", "During the newborn period, the elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery, normally seen in fetal life, may persist. This persistent pulmonary hypertension is mediated by continued production of vasoactive substances, such as thromboxane A2 and leukotrienes. High pulmonary vascular resistance increases pulmonary artery pressure and decreases pulmonary blood flow, resulting in cyanosis. This is commonly observed hours after birth in neonates with a history of fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, or respiratory depression post-delivery. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Closure of the ductus arteriosus is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis. The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta. It allows blood to bypass the lungs and flow directly to the systemic circulation. After birth, the ductus arteriosus normally closes within a few days. If the ductus arteriosus remains open, it can cause cyanosis because deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart can mix with oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart. This can lead to a decrease in the oxygen saturation of the blood. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The newborn was born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid, which is a sign of fetal distress. He has tachypnea and increased work of breathing. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. This suggests that the infant has developed persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN is a condition in which the pulmonary artery pressure remains high after birth, leading to right-to-left shunting of blood through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. This results in cyanosis and hypoxia. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The infant was born after a prolonged labor and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, which suggests that he experienced intrauterine hypoxia. This can lead to pulmonary hypertension, which can cause cyanosis. The infant's cyanosis improved with inhaled nitric oxide, which is a medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP and relaxes pulmonary arteries. However, the cyanosis returned 3 hours later, which suggests that the pulmonary hypertension has worsened. The most likely cause of this is closure of the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery. It allows blood to bypass the lungs and go directly to the systemic circulation. The ductus arteriosus normally closes shortly after birth.

[725, "Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with increasing swelling of his right jaw for the past 2 months. She notes that he has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but that they have not helped. She reports no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. The boy has no significant medical history. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. He is in the 85th percentile for height and weight, and he has been meeting all developmental milestones. His temperature is 37.8℃ (100.0℉). On physical examination, the patient has a prominent 8 × 8 cm mass over the right mandible. The mass has partially distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek. The overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?\nOptions: A: Babesia microti\tB: Bartonella henselae\tC: Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\tD: Epstein barr virus (EBV)\tE: Yersinia pestis", "D", ["The image shows histopathology of a biopsy of the patient's jaw mass, which is consistent with actinomycosis. Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative and granulomatous infection caused by anaerobic bacteria of the genus Actinomyces. The most common species is A. israelii, which is a normal inhabitant of the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract. Actinomycosis can occur in various forms, including cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic. The cervicofacial form is the most common, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. It typically presents as a slowly enlarging, painless mass in the jaw or cheek. The mass may eventually ulcerate and drain pus. Actinomycosis is typically diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and histopathology. The histopathology of actinomycosis shows characteristic \"sulfur granules,\" which are small, yellow-white granules composed of a central mass of intertwined hyphae surrounded by a zone of inflammatory cells. The sulfur granules can be seen on histopathology or cytology specimens. Treatment of actinomycosis typically involves prolonged antibiotic therapy with penicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The histopathologic analysis shows dense, chronic inflammation in the soft tissue with plasma cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages. The most likely microorganism associated with this patient's condition is Bartonella henselae, which is the causative agent of cat scratch disease. Cat scratch disease is a common infection that is usually transmitted by a scratch or bite from an infected cat. The infection typically causes a small, raised bump at the site of the scratch or bite. In some cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bones. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen shows clusters of multinucleated giant cells, which are characteristic of infection with Bartonella henselae. B. henselae is a gram-negative bacterium that is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected cat. The most common clinical manifestation of Bartonella infection is cat scratch disease, which typically presents as a self-limited regional lymphadenopathy. However, in some cases, the infection can disseminate and cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, weight loss, and neurologic abnormalities. The diagnosis of Bartonella infection is based on serologic testing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of tissue or blood specimens. Treatment typically includes a course of antibiotics. Therefore, the answer is: B", "Bartonella henselae is the most likely microorganism associated with this patient's condition because the histopathologic image shows a proliferation of endothelial cells within vascular spaces, which is a characteristic finding of bacillary angiomatosis, a condition caused by Bartonella henselae. Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare infectious disease that typically presents with cutaneous lesions, fever, and weight loss. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients. Therefore, the answer is: B", "The histopathologic analysis shows a mixture of small round blue cells (lymphoblasts) and plasma cells, and macrophages. This pattern is consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults in Africa. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus that is associated with Burkitt lymphoma. Infection with EBV is common in childhood and typically causes a mild illness, such as a sore throat or fever. However, in some people, EBV can cause more serious illnesses, such as Burkitt lymphoma. Therefore, the answer is: D"]]

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?\nOptions: A: Leydig cell tumor\tB: Obesity\tC: Thyroid disease\tD: Klinefelter syndrome\tE: Trauma to testis", "A", ["Trauma to testis is the most likely underlying cause of these findings. The patient has gynecomastia, a 1.5-cm nontender mass in the left testis, and a history of trauma to the left testicle 3 months ago. Trauma to the testis can cause damage to the Leydig cells, which are responsible for producing testosterone. This can lead to a decrease in testosterone levels and an increase in estrogen levels, which can cause gynecomastia. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has gynecomastia and a 1.5-cm mass in the left testis. The most likely underlying cause is Leydig cell tumor. Leydig cell tumors are the most common type of testicular tumor in adults. They usually produce testosterone or estrogen, which can lead to gynecomastia. The mass in the testis is likely the Leydig cell tumor. Therefore, the answer is: A", "Trauma to testis is the most likely underlying cause of these findings. The patient has a tender mass in the left testis, which is consistent with a hematocele or testicular contusion. He also has gynecomastia, which can be caused by the increased production of estrogen that occurs after testicular injury. The patient's alcohol intake and use of pantoprazole may also be contributing to the gynecomastia. Therefore, the answer is: E", "Trauma to testis is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's gynecomastia and left testicular mass. Testicular trauma can lead to the development of a hematocele, which is a collection of blood within the tunica vaginalis. Hematoceles can cause swelling and tenderness of the scrotum. They can also lead to the development of gynecomastia, which is the enlargement of breast tissue in men. The negative transillumination test suggests that the mass is solid, rather than a fluid-filled cyst. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has been experiencing progressive development of tender breast tissue over the past 18 months, and he has gained 5 kg (11 lb) during this period. He also has a nontender 1.5-cm mass in the left testis. The combination of gynecomastia, weight gain, and a testicular mass suggests a diagnosis of Leydig cell tumor. Leydig cell tumor is a rare testicular tumor that is characterized by the production of testosterone. Testosterone is a hormone that is responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as facial hair and muscle mass. In men with Leydig cell tumor, the high levels of testosterone can cause gynecomastia and weight gain. Therefore, the answer is: A"]]

If it is, this can result in altered airflow and the presence of a whistling noise. In this case, the whistling noise is likely due to the fact that the patient's septum is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow. Therefore, the answer is C.", "The most likely cause of the whistling noise is a deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow. Rhinoplasty can correct a deviated septum, which can improve nasal airflow. However, in some cases, the septum may be straightened too much, which can result in a whistling noise. This is because the septum helps to direct airflow through the nose. When the septum is too straight, the airflow can become turbulent, which can cause a whistling noise. Therefore, the answer is: C", "The most likely cause of the whistling noise is a fracture of the bony septum. This can occur during rhinoplasty, particularly if the surgeon is inexperienced or if the patient has a very thin or weak septum. A septal fracture can cause the septum to deviate, which can obstruct airflow and cause a whistling noise.

The patient has been exposed to a toxin (streptococcal toxins) that resulted in glomerular damage. Antigen-antibody complexes bind to the basement membrane of the glomeruli. The activated complement also binds to the basement membrane and further damages the glomerular capillaries. This appears as proteinuria and hematuria on urine analysis.

It is used to treat neutropenia and reduce the risk of infection in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Therefore, the answer is: E", "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a growth factor that stimulates the production of neutrophils and macrophages. It is used to treat neutropenia, which is a condition in which there is a low level of neutrophils in the blood. Neutropenia can occur as a side effect of chemotherapy, which is a type of cancer treatment. GM-CSF can help to prevent and treat neutropenia in patients who are receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, the answer is: E", "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that stimulates the production and maturation of neutrophils and macrophages. It is used to treat neutropenia, which is a condition in which the blood does not have enough neutrophils. Neutropenia is a common side effect of chemotherapy, and it can increase the risk of infection. Therefore, GM-CSF is often given to patients who are undergoing chemotherapy to prevent or treat neutropenia. Therefore, the answer is: E", "The patient has neutropenia, which is a condition in which the number of neutrophils in the blood is abnormally low. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps to fight infection.

Therefore, the answer is: C", "The strongest risk factor for this patient's condition is tick bite. The patient has a history of camping 3 weeks ago, which is a common time and place for tick bites. She also has a tender pustule on the sole of her left foot, which is a common early sign of Lyme disease, which is a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks. The cloudy knee joint fluid with a high leukocyte count and intracellular organisms is also consistent with Lyme disease. Therefore, the answer is: A", "The patient has asymmetric inflammatory arthritis of the knee and wrist with a high leukocyte count and intracellular organisms in the synovial fluid. She also has a pustule on the sole of her left foot. The most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis, and the strongest risk factor for this condition is intravenous drug use.

[797, "Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes for the past 2 months. He does not complain of any pain during urination. He is frustrated that he has to wake up 2 or 3 times per night to urinate even though he tried reducing the amount of water he consumes before bed and made some other dietary changes without any improvement. He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness.

DRE is a physical examination of the prostate gland and surrounding structures. It is performed by inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel the prostate gland. DRE can help to identify any abnormalities in the prostate gland, such as enlargement, tenderness, or nodules. In this patient with symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), DRE is an important step in the evaluation to assess the size and consistency of the prostate gland and to rule out other conditions, such as prostate cancer. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The best next step in the management of this patient is a digital rectal examination. This is because the patient has symptoms suggestive of prostate enlargement, such as increased urinary frequency and decreased urinary volumes. A digital rectal examination can help to assess the size and consistency of the prostate gland, and to detect any abnormalities such as nodules or induration. Therefore, the answer is: D", "Digital rectal examination is the best next step in the management of this patient because it is a simple and relatively non-invasive procedure that can provide valuable information about the prostate gland. It can help to detect abnormalities such as enlargement, nodules, or tenderness, which may indicate an underlying problem such as prostatitis or prostate cancer. A urinalysis and serum creatinine can help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a urinary tract infection or kidney disease. Ultrasonography can be used to further evaluate the prostate gland, but it is typically not necessary as a first-line test. Reassurance is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are suggestive of an underlying medical condition that requires further evaluation. Prostate-specific antigen is a blood test that can be used to screen for prostate cancer, but it is not routinely recommended in patients with symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therefore, the answer is: D", "The patient presents with increased urinary frequency and decreased volumes. These symptoms are suggestive of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which are common in men as they age. The most common cause of LUTS in men is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a blood test used to screen for prostate cancer. A digital rectal examination (DRE) is a physical exam of the prostate gland performed by a physician to assess for abnormalities. A urinalysis and serum creatinine are used to assess for urinary tract infection and renal function. Ultrasonography is used to image the prostate gland and assess for abnormalities such as BPH or prostate cancer.
