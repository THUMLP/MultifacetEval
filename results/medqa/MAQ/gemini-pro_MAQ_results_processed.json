It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms.

[274, "Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia.
